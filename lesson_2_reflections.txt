What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository, it will change the repository to git repository. This is for doing git command on that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area will save the file which you want to add in git repository. It will help us to not be confused by the files in repository.
